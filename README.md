This project integraded a typo3-container into a mariadb-cluster as centrual database system.

The main on typo3-install based on: dockerhub://martinhelm/typo3:8 images of martinhelm. Great thanks on you pre-working and a good startup of my projects. 

The main-problem on project was created a good php-container-image with dependency's and libary's of actual application deployments and versions. We searched a minimal-php installation on alpine and co as basic running-containers on installations. The secundary part was configure typo3-application to stable running and production readyness into containers. The main construct run allways to day, but her is not included the action patchingon last typo3-versions. This is your's power to using this setup on you infrastructure. Here is only the main-construct of environment and a old production ready-example as start of your's runtime setup. For more information please contact mainters of this project.
